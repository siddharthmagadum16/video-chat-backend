# Video chat backend
This is the server or backend part of video chat web application. <br>
The backend deployment is done on render (but by using vercel branch) <br>
Rest all deployments can be ignored, as they weren't working well. Cyclic and Vercel didnt support websocket connections. So, there were no response for wss API requests.<br>
However, frontend is deployed on vercel.
